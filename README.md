The code in the ClientService class is responsible for managing client-related operations. It uses a ClientManager to interact with the database. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:
1.	Class Definition and Dependencies:
•	The ClientService class implements the IClientService interface.
•	It has a private field _connectionString that holds the database connection string.
•	It has a private field _clientManager which is an instance of ClientManager.
2.	Constructor:
•	The constructor initializes the _clientManager with the _connectionString.



•	AddClient(string name, string gender, string details): Calls the AddClient method of _clientManager to add a new client to the database.
•	AddEmp(Client client): Calls the AddEmp method of _clientManager to add a new employee (client) to the database.
•	AddAddress(int clientId, string addressType, string addressLine): Calls the AddAddress method of _clientManager to add an address for a client.
•	AddContact(int clientId, string contactType, string contactValue): Calls the AddContact method of _clientManager to add a contact for a client.
•	GetClient(int clientId): Calls the GetClient method of _clientManager to retrieve a client by their ID. It includes error handling to log and rethrow exceptions.
•	GetAllClients(): Calls the GetAllClients method of _clientManager to retrieve all clients and converts the result to a list.
